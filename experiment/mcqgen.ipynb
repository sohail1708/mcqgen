      "Text:Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC[a]; sign: ₿) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Nodes in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger, called a blockchain, without central oversight. Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally intensive process based on proof of work, called mining, that requires increasing quantities of electricity and guarantees the security of the bitcoin blockchain.[5]\n",
      "Based on a free market ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown person.[6] Use of bitcoin as a currency began in 2009,[7] with the release of its open-source implementation.[8]: ch. 1  In 2021, El Salvador adopted it as legal tender.[4] Bitcoin is currently used more as a store of value and less as a medium of exchange or unit of account. It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by many scholars as an economic bubble.[9] As bitcoin is pseudonymous, its use by criminals has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to its ban by several countries as of 2021.[10]\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Before bitcoin, several digital cash technologies were released, starting with David Chaum's ecash in the 1980s.[11] The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.[11] The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.[11] The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998.[12] In 2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work.[13] These various attempts were not successful:[11] Chaum's concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against double-spending, while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks.[11]\n",
      "2008–2009: Creation\n",
      "Bitcoin logos made by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 (left) and 2010 (right) depict bitcoins as gold tokens.\n",
      "The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008.[14] On 31 October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[15] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[7] Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.[6] All individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature.[11] Nakamoto's innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain.[11][16] Nakamoto's paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work, based on theoretical models, even though it was working in practice.[11]\n",
      "On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block.[17] Embedded in this block was the text \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\", which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper.[7] Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.[18] Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters.[17] In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000.[19]\n",
      "2020–present\n",
      "Bitcoin price in US dollars\n",
      "In 2020, some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin: MicroStrategy invested $250 million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,[40] Square, Inc., $50 million,[41] and MassMutual, $100 million.[42] In November 2020, PayPal added support for bitcoin in the US.[43]\n",
      "In February 2021, Bitcoin's market capitalization reached $1 trillion for the first time.[44] In November 2021, the Taproot soft-fork upgrade was activated, adding support for Schnorr signatures, improved functionality of smart contracts and Lightning Network.[45] Before, Bitcoin only used a custom elliptic curve with the ECDSA algorithm to produce signatures.[46]: 101  In September 2021, Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar.[4] In October 2021, the first bitcoin futures ETF, called BITO, from ProShares was approved by the SEC and listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[47]\n",
      "In May and June 2022, the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of TerraUSD, a stablecoin,[48] and the Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency loan company.[49][50]\n",
      "In 2023, ordinals, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin, went live.[51] In January 2024, the first 11 US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began trading, offering direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges.[52][53]\n",

It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by many scholars as an economic bubble.[9] As bitcoin is pseudonymous, its use by criminals has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to its ban by several countries as of 2021.[10]\\nBackground\\nBefore bitcoin, several digital cash technologies were released, starting with David Chaum\\'s ecash in the 1980s.[11] The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.[11] The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.[11] The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998.[12] In 2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work.[13] These various attempts were not successful:[11] Chaum\\'s concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against double-spending, while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks.[11]\\n2008–2009: Creation\\nBitcoin logos made by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 (left) and 2010 (right) depict bitcoins as gold tokens.\\nThe domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008.[14] On 31 October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[15] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[7] Nakamoto\\'s identity remains unknown.[6] All individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature.[11] Nakamoto\\'s innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain.[11][16] Nakamoto\\'s paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work, based on theoretical models, even though it was working in practice.[11]\\nOn 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block.[17] Embedded in this block was the text \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\", which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper.[7] Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.[18] Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters.[17] In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John\\'s pizzas for ₿10,000.[19]\\n2020–present\\nBitcoin price in US dollars\\nIn 2020, some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin: MicroStrategy invested $250 million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,[40] Square, Inc., $50 million,[41] and MassMutual, $100 million.[42] In November 2020, PayPal added support for bitcoin in the US.[43]\\nIn February 2021, Bitcoin\\'s market capitalization reached $1 trillion for the first time.[44] In November 2021, the Taproot soft-fork upgrade was activated, adding support for Schnorr signatures, improved functionality of smart contracts and Lightning Network.[45] Before, Bitcoin only used a custom elliptic curve with the ECDSA algorithm to produce signatures.[46]:\\u200a101\\u200a In September 2021, Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar.[4] In October 2021, the first bitcoin futures ETF, called BITO, from ProShares was approved by the SEC and listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[47]\\nIn May and June 2022, the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of TerraUSD, a stablecoin,[48] and the Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency loan company.[49][50]\\nIn 2023, ordinals, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin, went live.[51] In January 2024, the first 11 US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began trading, offering direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges.[52][53]',\n",
